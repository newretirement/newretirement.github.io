# FPE Optimizer - Roth Conversions

Given a financial Plan, the Roth Conversion Optimizer (RCO) attempts to find an optimal set of Roth conversions that satisfy the given set of goals and constraints (some of which are optional):

- Maximize estate value
- Restrict annual conversion amount such that the estimated conversion tax can be funded strictly from aftertax accounts.
